**Why is this system open-sourced?**

We believe in transparency, collaboration and the power of open-source community. By open-sourcing critical parts of our warehouse management system, we aim to contribute to a broader humanitarian goal and enchance the security of our own product.

As an organization focused on humanitarian aid, transparency is important to our operation. Open sourcing out login and data management modules provides full visibility into the methods we use to securely store and manage sensitive data and warehouse inventory. These systems are designed to handle a large scale of data in a secure and efficient manner.

If you believe that the system is compromised in any way or requires editing, please be sure to open an issue and describe it in details.
