**Why is this system open-sourced?**

We believe in transparency, collaboration and the power of open-source community. By open-sourcing critical parts of our warehouse management system, we aim to 
contribute to a broader humanitarian goal and enchance the security of our own product.

As an organization focused on humanitarian aid, transparency is important to our operation. Open sourcing out login and data management modules provides full 
visibility into the methods we use to securely store and manage sensitive data and warehouse inventory. These systems are designed to handle a large scale of 
data in a secure and efficient manner.

**Security audits policy**

We kindly ask you to open a security advisory through our github repository. That is the only channel through which the reports will be considered.
Please consider that your report might not be attended to immediately. That in turn is not enough grounds for publicly disclosing the vulnerability.
